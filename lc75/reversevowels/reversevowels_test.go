In my work as a container technology evangelist, I've encountered misuse of container terminology that causes people to stumble on the road to mastering containers. Terms like containers and images are used interchangeably, but there are important conceptual differences. In the world of containers, repository has a different meaning than what you'd expect. Additionally, the landscape for container technologies is larger than just docker.
